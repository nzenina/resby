The Virtual Assistant will provide support for the user, and provide information about coping, gradually
increasing the resilience of the user.

The Virtual Assistant will be located in a website that is dedicated to the mental wellbeing.
VA will be made in a natural processing language RASA.
Virtual Assistant will provide a support for anxious users, or an entertaining chat for bored users, and in
all cases it will provide an engaging information about healthy coping strategies in a such user-friendly
way that the user actually embraces those strategies as his own, thus increasing his resilience.
VA will learn from the user responses and the feedback thus improving the user experience and user
outcomes.
